# MyDrive
This is a simple docking window displayed on the desktop that allows easy access to your hard drives or drives located on the local network. Although it does show the device space information in a pretty fancy way. MyDrive was intended to make my life easier by sharing resources on my home network. And since Windows can't display space information on drives located on the network, this does.
